# Crypto P2P Trading Platform

## Description

Welcome to the Crypto P2P Trading Platform repository! ðŸš€

This project is a cryptocurrency peer-to-peer trading platform built using Laravel, React.js, and Inertia. The goal of this platform is to empower users to securely and efficiently trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another.

## Key Features

- **Communication and Reviews**: In-platform messaging and user reviews.
- **Referrals**: Earn rewards by inviting others to join.
